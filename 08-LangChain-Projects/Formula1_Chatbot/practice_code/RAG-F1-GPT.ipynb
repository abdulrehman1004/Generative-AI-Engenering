The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, and automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994.

The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start.[5][6] Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.[7]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One', 'title': 'Formula One - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950.[8] Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957.[9] This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.[9]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One', 'title': 'Formula One - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"Juan Manuel Fangio's 1951 title-winning Alfa Romeo 159\\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship.[10] Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times.[11][12] Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered—still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver.[13] National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.[14][15]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One', 'title': 'Formula One - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars.[16][17] When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork.

Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.[20]\\nDuring 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design.

The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.[22]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One', 'title': 'Formula One - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Big business[edit]\\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One\\'s commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is.[23][24] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors\\' Association, and in 1978, he became its president.[25] Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA.[24] He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave.

FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races.[23] The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations.[27] Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.[28]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One', 'title': 'Formula One - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='FISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983.[29] But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520\\xa0kW (700\\xa0bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5\\xa0bar (80\\xa0psi) pressure, estimated[who?] to be over 970\\xa0kW (1,300\\xa0bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820\\xa0kW (1,100\\xa0bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0\\xa0bar.[30] These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever.

In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races\\' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season.

This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track.

This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One', 'title': 'Formula One - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Drivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens.

He later was let past by his teammate Piastri, who received a ten-second penalty earlier for causing a collision with Lawson. Verstappen took his first victory in ten races after starting from seventeenth on the grid. He was joined on the podium by Ocon and Gasly, marking Alpine's first-ever double podium and their first podiums of the season.[115]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Formula_One_World_Championship', 'title': '2024 Formula One World Championship - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"Verstappen had a chance to secure his fourth World Drivers' Championship title at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with him being able to do so as long as he outscored Norris.[116] Russell took pole position and led a majority of the race from lights to flag, leading Hamilton, who endured a poor qualification, behind him.
