<h1 style="color:#58A6FF; font-weight:bold; border-bottom:2px solid #30363D;">What is Generative AI:</h1>

Generative AI, sometimes called gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content—such as text, images, video, audio or software code—in response to a user’s prompt or request.

Generative AI relies on sophisticated [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) models called [_deep learning_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning) *models*—algorithms that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain. These models work by identifying and encoding the patterns and relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that information to understand users' natural language requests or questions and respond with relevant new content.

<h1 style="color:#58A6FF; font-weight:bold; border-bottom:2px solid #30363D;">How generative AI works</h1>

For the most part, generative AI operates in three phases:

1. **Training**, to create a foundation model that can serve as the basis of multiple gen AI applications.
2. **Tuning**, to tailor the foundation model to a specific gen AI application.
3. **Generation**, **evaluation and retuning**, to assess the gen AI application's output and continually improve its quality and accuracy.

## **1. Training a Foundational Model:**

Generative AI starts with something called a **foundation model**—a deep learning model that can be used for many types of content creation. Right now, the most common type of foundation model is the **Large Language Model (LLM)**, which is used for generating text. but there are also foundation models for image generation, video generation, and sound and music generation—as well as multimodal foundation models that can support several kinds content generation.

### How a Foundation Model is Made:

1. **Training on Massive Data**: To create a foundation model, developers train a deep learning algorithm using huge amounts of data. This data can come from the internet or other large sources, and it doesn’t need to be organized or labeled.
2. **Learning Patterns**: The algorithm tries to solve **fill in the blank** exercises. For example, it predicts the next word in a sentence or the next piece of an image. It repeats this millions of times, adjusting itself to get closer to the correct answer.
3. **Neural Network Creation**: Through this process, the model learns patterns, relationships, and how things are connected in the data. The result is a neural network—a system that can then create new content based on input it gets, like a prompt.

### Challenges:

- **Expensive and Time-Consuming**: This training process requires a lot of computing power—thousands of GPUs (special computer hardware) working together for weeks. This makes it very expensive, costing millions of dollars.
- **Open-Source Solutions**: Some companies, like Meta with **Llama-2**, have made their foundation models open-source. This allows developers to use these models without having to go through the expensive and time-consuming process of training their own.

In short, foundation models are like the brain behind generative AI, but building them requires a lot of data, time, and money. Fortunately, open-source projects help developers skip the hardest part!

## **2. Tuning a Foundation Model:**

Think of a **foundation model** as a generalist—it knows a lot about different things, but it's not perfect at specific tasks. To make it better at certain tasks, like answering customer service questions or writing code, the model needs some adjustments. This process is called **tuning**.

### Fine-Tuning

**Fine-tuning** is like giving the model extra lessons in a specific area. To do this:

- Developers collect a lot of labeled data. For example, if the goal is to create a **customer service chatbot**, they gather hundreds or thousands of examples of real customer questions and correct answers.
- The model is then trained on this specific data, so it gets better at handling those particular questions.

However, this process is **time-consuming** and can take a lot of work. Developers often hire other companies to help with the task of labeling all this data.

### Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

In **RLHF**, the model learns from **real human feedback**:

- People interact with the model, give it feedback, or even score different responses. For instance, if a chatbot provides an answer, a human might give it a score (e.g., how helpful or accurate the response was).
- The model uses this feedback to improve and become more accurate.

Sometimes, this feedback is as simple as humans typing corrections when the model makes a mistake, or talking to a virtual assistant and improving its responses over time.

### In summary:

- **Fine-tuning** is like giving the model specialized lessons.
- **RLHF** is about learning from people’s real-time feedback to get better at a task.

Both of these methods help make the model more useful for specific tasks!

## **3. Generation, evaluation, more tuning:**

Generative AI models are always being assessed and improved:

- **Developers and users** regularly check the results the AI generates, whether it's creating text, images, or something else.
- They use these evaluations to **further tune** the model, sometimes **weekly**, to improve its accuracy or relevance.

However, the **foundation model** (the base of the AI) is updated far less often—maybe once a year or every 18 months. The smaller, more frequent updates happen on top of this foundation to make sure the model stays relevant for its specific task.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**RAG** is another way to improve how generative AI works:

- Imagine the foundation model as a smart brain that’s learned a lot, but it only knows what it was trained on. Sometimes, it doesn’t have the most up-to-date information or access to specific knowledge that’s outside its training.
- RAG steps in by letting the model **use outside sources**—such as the latest information or specific databases—that weren't included in its original training. This makes the AI's results more **current** and **accurate**.
- With RAG, users can actually see where the AI is pulling its information from (like links or references), which makes it more **transparent**. This is different from the foundation model, where the sources of its knowledge aren't always clear.

### Summary

- Developers regularly fine-tune the model based on feedback, improving its accuracy over time.
- **RAG** allows the model to access fresh, relevant information from outside its training data, ensuring the model can handle the latest updates. It also offers more transparency by showing where it got its information.

This way, generative AI keeps improving and stays updated with new data sources!

- **Why they’re important**: GANs are known for generating **photo-realistic images and videos**. They are also used in **style transfer** (e.g., turning a photo into a sketch) and **data augmentation** (creating synthetic data to increase the diversity of training sets).
- **Strength**: GANs are especially powerful for creating high-quality, realistic images.

### 3. **Diffusion Models** – Introduced in 2014

- **What they do**: Diffusion models work by adding random noise to the data and then gradually removing that noise to reveal a high-quality output.
- **Strength**: These models offer **fine-grained control** over the generated content and are used in advanced tools like **DALL-E** for creating highly detailed images.
- **Limitation**: Diffusion models take longer to train compared to VAEs and GANs, but they are excellent for precise, high-quality image generation.

### 4. **Transformers** – Introduced in 2017

- **What they do**: Transformers represent a big leap in AI. Unlike previous models, they use a technique called **attention** to focus on the most important parts of data sequences, like entire sentences instead of single words. This allows them to understand context better.
- **Why they’re groundbreaking**: Transformers power today’s most advanced AI tools like **ChatGPT**, **GPT-4**, and **BERT**. They are faster, more efficient, and excel at **natural language processing (NLP)**, generating highly accurate and complex content such as poems, articles, or code.
- **Key Features**:
  - They process **entire sequences** of data at once, capturing the context.
  - They can generate longer, more coherent responses, and even be trained to use tools like **spreadsheets** or **drawing programs**.
